  ab: As a result of glacio-isostatic rebound, large regions of Fennoscandia have
    undergone a process of relative sea-level fall following the retreat of the Fennoscandian
    Ice Sheet.Furthermore, coastal Stone Age sites in the region appear to have been
    predominantly located on or close to the shoreline when they were in use.Based
    on their altitude relative to the present-day sea-level, this can be combined
    with a reconstruction of past relative sea-level change to assign an approximate
    date to when the sites were in use.This method, called shoreline dating, has been
    used in the region since the early 1900s (e.g.Brøgger, 1905) and is still widely
    applied today (e.g.

  title: A Bayesian alternative for Aoristic analyses in archaeology
  display_name: A Bayesian alternative for Aoristic analyses in archaeology
  author:
  - ~
  ab: Aoristic analysis is often used to handle chronological uncertainties of datasets
    where scientific dates (e.g. 14C, OSL, etc.) are not available, and observations
    are described by association to archaeological periods or phases. While several
    advances have been made over the last two decades, the basic principle of this
    approach remains fundamentally the same. Temporal windows of analyses are first
    divided into regularly sized time-blocks and probability weight is assigned to
    each of these for every observation. Weights are then aggregated by time-block,
    and the resulting vector of summed probabilities is interpreted as a curve representing
    changes in the intensity over time of a particular phenomenon. This paper reviews
    the basic principles and assumptions of aoristic analyses in archaeology, highlighting
    several issues with its application and interpretation and advocating for a Bayesian
    alternative implemented via baorista, a new package written in R statistical computing
    language. The robustness of the proposed solution is evaluated through a series
    of experiments based on simulated datasets, which showcase key advantages over
    aoristic analysis. Two specific solutions are considered, a parametric approach
    where data are fitted to specific growth models and a non-parametric approach
    that allows a visualisation of the changing frequencies of events that account
    for sampling error and the peculiarities of archaeological periodisation.

  title: How Does the Southern Annular Mode Control Surface Melt in East Antarctica?
  display_name: How Does the Southern Annular Mode Control Surface Melt in East Antarctica?
  author:
  - ~
  ab: Abstract Surface melt in East Antarctica is strongly correlated with the Southern
    Annular Mode (SAM) index, but the spatiotemporal variability of the relationship,
    and the physical processes responsible for it, have not been examined. Here, using
    melt flux estimates and climate variables from the RACMO2.3p3 regional climate
    model, we show that a decreasing SAM index is associated with increased melt in
    Dronning Maud Land primarily owing to reduced precipitation and greater absorption
    of solar radiation. Conversely, in Wilkes Land, a decreasing SAM index corresponds
    to increased melt because of greater incoming longwave radiation from a warmer
    atmosphere. We also demonstrate that SAM‐melt correlations are strongest in December
    as the melt season develops, and that the SAM’s influence on peak melt intensities
    in January occurs indirectly through the snowmelt‐albedo feedback. Future work
    must account for such variability in the physical processes underlying the SAM‐melt
    relationship to reduce uncertainty in surface melt projections.

  title: Genome-wide local ancestry and the functional consequences of admixture in
    African and European cattle populations
  display_name: Genome-wide local ancestry and the functional consequences of admixture
    in African and European cattle populations
  author:
  - ~
  ab: <title>Abstract</title> <italic>Bos taurus</italic> (taurine) and <italic>Bos
    indicus</italic> (indicine) cattle diverged at least 150,000 years ago and, since
    that time, substantial genomic differences have evolved between the two lineages.
    During the last two millennia, genetic exchange in Africa has resulted in a complex
    tapestry of taurine-indicine ancestry, with most cattle populations exhibiting
    varying levels of admixture. Similarly, there are several Southern European cattle
    populations that also show evidence for historical gene flow from indicine cattle,
    the highest levels of which are found in the Central Italian White breeds. Here
    we use two different software tools (MOSAIC and ELAI) for local ancestry inference
    (LAI) with genome-wide high- and low-density SNP array data sets in hybrid African
    and Italian cattle populations and obtained broadly similar results despite critical
    differences in the two LAI methodologies used. Our analyses identified genomic
    regions with elevated levels of retained or introgressed ancestry from the African
    taurine, European taurine, Asian indicine lineages. Functional enrichment of genes
    underlying these ancestry peaks highlighted biological processes relating to immunobiology
    and olfaction, some of which may relate to differing susceptibilities to infectious
    diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, East Coast fever, and tropical theileriosis.
    Notably, for retained African taurine ancestry in admixed trypanotolerant cattle
    we observed enrichment of genes associated with haemoglobin and oxygen transport.
    This may reflect positive selection of genomic variants that enhance control of
    severe anaemia, a debilitating feature of trypanosomiasis disease, which severely
    constrains cattle agriculture across much of sub-Saharan Africa.

  ab: A high incidence of asthma is prevalent among residents near the Salton Sea,
    a large inland terminal lake in southern California. This arid region has high
    levels of ambient particulate matter (PM); yet while high PM levels are often
    associated with asthma in many environments, it is possible that the rapidly retreating
    lake, and exposed playa or lakebed, may contribute components with a specific
    role in promoting asthma symptoms.Our hypothesis is that asthma may be higher
    in residents closest to the Salton Sea due to chronic exposures to playa dust.
    Playa emissions may be concentrating dissolved material from the lake, with microbial
    components capable of inducing pulmonary innate immune responses. To test this
    hypothesis, we used a mouse model of aerosol exposures to assess the effects of
    playa dust.From dust collected around the Salton Sea region, aqueous extracts
    were used to generate aerosols, which were injected into an environmental chamber
    for mouse exposure studies. We compared the effects of exposure to Salton Sea
    aerosols, as well as to known immunostimulatory reference materials. Acute 48-h
    and chronic 7-day exposures were compared, with lungs analyzed for inflammatory
    cell recruitment and gene expression.Dust from sites nearest to the Salton Sea
    triggered lung neutrophil inflammation that was stronger at 48-h but reduced at
    7-days. This acute inflammatory profile and kinetics resembled the response to
    innate immune ligands LTA and LPS while distinct from the classic allergic response
    to Alternaria.Lung inflammatory responses to Salton Sea dusts are similar to acute
    innate immune responses, raising the possibility that microbial components are
    entrained in the dust, promoting inflammation. This effect highlights the health
    risks at drying terminal lakes from inflammatory components in dust emissions
    from exposed lakebed.

  title: Divergent vertebral formulae shape the evolution of axial complexity in mammals
  display_name: Divergent vertebral formulae shape the evolution of axial complexity
    in mammals
  author:
  - ~
  ab: Abstract Complexity, defined as the number of parts and their degree of differentiation,
    is a poorly explored aspect of macroevolutionary dynamics. The maximum anatomical
    complexity of organisms has undoubtedly increased through evolutionary time. However,
    it is unclear whether this increase is a purely diffusive process or whether it
    is at least partly driven, occurring in parallel in most or many lineages and
    with increases in the minima as well as the means. Highly differentiated and serially
    repeated structures, such as vertebrae, are useful systems with which to investigate
    these patterns. We focus on the serial differentiation of the vertebral column
    in 1,136 extant mammal species, using two indices that quantify complexity as
    the numerical richness and proportional distribution of vertebrae across presacral
    regions and a third expressing the ratio between thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.
    We address three questions. First, we ask whether the distribution of complexity
    values in major mammal groups is similar or whether clades have specific signatures
    associated with their ecology. Second, we ask whether changes in complexity throughout
    the phylogeny are biased towards increases and whether there is evidence of driven
    trends. Third, we ask whether evolutionary shifts in complexity depart from a
    uniform Brownian motion model. Vertebral counts, but not complexity indices, differ
    significantly between major groups and exhibit greater within-group variation
    than recognized hitherto. We find strong evidence of a trend towards increasing
    complexity, where higher values propagate further increases in descendant lineages.
    Several increases are inferred to have coincided with major ecological or environmental
    shifts. We find support for multiple-rate models of evolution for all complexity
    metrics, suggesting that increases in complexity occurred in stepwise shifts,
    with evidence for widespread episodes of recent rapid divergence. Different subclades
    evolve more complex vertebral columns in different configurations and probably
    under different selective pressures and constraints, with widespread convergence
    on the same formulae. Further work should therefore focus on the ecological relevance
    of differences in complexity and a more detailed understanding of historical patterns.

  title: 'Diversity of diversity indices: Which diversity measure is better?'
  display_name: 'Diversity of diversity indices: Which diversity measure is better?'
  author:
  - ~
  ab: 'The article evaluates the dependence of the most common indices of species
    diversity on sample size and determines their ability to differentiate between
    different types of ecosystems, with a special emphasis on discriminating between
    natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. An approach to adjusting the indices to
    reduce their dependence on sample size was also proposed. The study was conducted
    in seven types of ecosystems: four were natural and three were anthropogenically
    transformed. Samples of soil animals were selected in 2011–2013 and 2021 using
    the same methods. A total of 20,518 soil animal specimens belonging to 202 species
    were collected in all study locations. The null alternative was generated by randomly
    selecting samples containing 2, 3, ..., 110 soil animals from the combined soil
    animal sample. For each gradation of sample size, 200 sample variants were formed.
    The density of soil macrofauna in natural ecosystems ranged from 3.6 ± 1.5 to
    15.2 ± 6.9 specimens per sample, and in artificial ecosystems – from 13.2 ± 7.6
    to 21.0 ± 11.9 specimens per sample. The number of species ranged from 22–80 species,
    and in artificial ecosystems it was 38–99 species. Indicators of species diversity
    correlated with each other. A high level of correlation was observed between indicators
    within groups of indices: indices of species richness and indices of heterogeneity
    and evenness. Fisher’s log-series alpha and the fundamental parameter of biodiversity
    were highly correlated with each other, as well as with the Margalef, species
    richness, and Chao’s species abundance indices. The log-normal distribution best
    describes the dominance patterns in terms of abundance in the natural ecosystems,
    and the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution best describes the dominance patterns in
    terms of abundance in the artificial ecosystems. Diversity indices were ordered
    in the space of two dimensions, one explaining the variation between ecosystems
    and the other depending on sample size. The ordering of the traditional indices
    showed that there is a vacancy for the best index in the sense that such an index
    should best explain differences between ecosystems and differences between natural
    and artificial ecosystems. It should also be independent of sample size. The Simpson
    heterogeneity index and the Simpson evenness index were the best of the traditional
    indices, but they did not explain differences between ecosystems very well, especially
    when it came to distinguishing between natural and artificial ecosystems. The
    Margalef index, which is supposed to be independent of sample size, on the other
    hand, showed a very high level of dependence. Such a dependence was also found
    for the Menhinick index, though to a lesser extent. Obviously, size dependence
    negatively affects the differential ability of the indices. The corrected indices
    of species richness and the Shannon index are practically independent of sample
    size and have a greater ability to differentiate ecosystems by the level of diversity,
    with natural ecosystems characterized by consistently higher values of the corrected
    indices than artificial ecosystems. The dependence on the sample size makes indices
    from different ecosystems practically incomparable, which makes their use meaningless.
    Even minor differences in sample size can lead to significant deviations in the
    values of diversity indices. The application of the Michaelis-Menten model allowed
    us to suggest a method of correction of species richness indices and the Shannon
    index. After the correction, the indices are practically independent of the sample
    size, and their differential ability to characterize individual ecosystems and
    the level of anthropogenic transformation increases significantly.'

  ab: Abstract Offshore Oil and Gas (O&amp;G) infrastructure affords structurally
    complex hard substrata in otherwise featurless areas of the seafloor. Opportunistically
    collected industrial ROV imagery was used to investigate the colonization of a
    petroleum platform in the North Sea 1–2 years following installation. Compared
    to pre-construction communities and pioneering colonizers, we documented 48 additional
    taxa, including a rare sighting of a pompano (Trachinotus ovatus). The second
    wave of motile colonizers presented greater diversity than the pioneering community.
    Occurrence of species became more even over the 2 years following installation,
    with species occurring in more comparable abundances. No on-jacket sessile taxa
    were recorded during first-wave investigations; however, 17 sessile species were
    detected after 1 year (decreasing to 16 after 2). Motile species were found to
    favour structurally complex sections of the jacket (e.g. mudmat), while sessile
    organisms favoured exposed elements. Evidence of on-jacket reproduction was found
    for two commercially important invertebrate species - common whelk (Buccinum undatum)
    and European squid (Loligo vulgaris). Moreover, abundance of larvae-producing
    species experience an 8.5-fold increase over a 2-year period compared to baseline
    communities. These findings may have implications for decommissioning and resource-management
    strategies, suggesting that a case-by-case reviewing approach should be favoured
    over the most common “one size fits all”.

  ab: 'Distinguishing between spatial entities is fundamental in archaeology since
    archaeologists deal with spatial phenomena at multiple scales of analysis.During

    archaeologists deduce former connection relationships from the symmetry and the
    possibility of contact of significantly large surface areas from two fragments,
    which can be physically adjusted (the fragments "refit").Here, "connection" is
    used as a shorthand to refer to the connection relationship that existed in the

  title: Ecosystem functional types of the circumpolar Arctic tundra based on the
    seasonal dynamics of vegetation productivity
  display_name: Ecosystem functional types of the circumpolar Arctic tundra based
    on the seasonal dynamics of vegetation productivity
  author:

  ab: Abstract Biodiversity, when viewed through the combined lenses of compositional,
    structural, and functional attributes, provides for a holistic understanding of
    the complexities found within community assemblages and ecosystems. However, advancement
    in our understanding of how ecosystem functional diversity interacts with structural
    and compositional diversity metrics is lacking, in part because universally applied
    methodologies to derive ecosystem functional classifications are still under development
    and vary widely across scales, extents and biomes. This study presents a methodology
    to construct ecosystem functional types (EFTs), or areas of the land surface that
    function similarly, using the MODIS NDVI record, for the terrestrial circumpolar
    Arctic. EFTs were derived from the seasonal dynamics of NDVI, over the Arctic
    tundra at 250 m resolution and compared to bioclimate subzones and to structurally
    and compositionally defined vegetation units of the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation
    Map (CAVM). Correspondence analyses of CAVM EFTs to previously delineated CAVM
    bioclimatic subzones, physiognomic (vegetation) units and floristic provinces
    revealed a general congruence, indicating convergence across composition, structure,
    and function; yet also demonstrated substantial functional variability even within
    bioclimate subzones and vegetation units. Strong latitudinal gradients in ecosystem
    function are present, with EFT richness ranging from low (34) in northernmost
    regions to high (45) in southernmost regions. Locally, the mountainous regions
    of northern Alaska, and eastern and western Siberia had high spatial variability
    in ecosystem functioning. Aside from these generalities, we found that EFTs varied
    widely within individual mapped vegetation units, successfully capturing the functional
    dimension of biodiversity across the circumpolar Arctic tundra.

  ab: Abstract Background Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and enzymes,
    which are pivotal for life on Earth. Amino acid usage provides critical insights
    into the functional constraints acting on proteins and illuminates molecular mechanisms
    underpinning traits. Despite this, we have limited knowledge of the genome-wide
    signatures of amino acid usage across domains of life, precluding new genome and
    proteome patterns to being discovered. Results Here, we analysed the proteomes
    of 5,590 species across four domains of life and found that only a small subset
    of amino acids is most and least frequently used across proteomes. This creates
    a ubiquitous ‘edge effect’ on amino acid usage diversity by rank that arises from
    protein secondary structural constrains. This edge effect was not driven by the
    evolutionary chronology of amino acids, showing that functional rather than evolutionary
    constrains shape amino acid usage in the proteome. We also tested contemporary
    hypotheses about similarities in amino acid usage profiles and the relationship
    between amino acid usage and growth temperature, and found that, contrary to previous
    beliefs, amino acid usage varies across domains of life and temperature only weakly
    contributes to variance in amino acid usage. Conclusion We have described a novel
    and ubiquitous pattern of amino acid usage signature across genomes, which reveals
    how structural constrains shape amino acid usage at the proteome level. This can
    ultimately influence the way in which we probe deep evolutionary relationships
    of protein families across the tree of life and engineer biology in synthetic
    biology.

  ab: We studied the distribution of chigger mite species over mammal hosts, attachment
    sites on the host body, habitats, and seasons in Iran. The study was based on
    2155 specimens of 36 chigger species collected from 10 species of Muridae, Cricetidae,
    and Soricidae across six provinces of northern Iran. A high level of mixed infestation
    by chiggers was recorded-76% of hosts parasitized by chiggers were infested by
    more than one (2-8) species. Statistically significant differences in the preference
    for anterior and posterior parts of the host body were found. Three species-Neotrombicula
    lubrica, N. delijani, and Cheladonta firdousii-preferred the posterior part of
    the host body; 12 species were characterized by the occurrence in the anterior
    part and differed from one another by the frequency of presence in the posterior
    part. One species, Hirsutiella alpina, was found only in the anterior part of
    the host body (inside the ears of rodents). The most diverse chigger fauna was
    on the fringe of Golestan National Park (species richness = 21, Shannon-Wiener
    index = 2.823). The chigger fauna of the high-mountain localities on the Alborz
    Range was the least diverse (species richness = 16, Shannon-Wiener index = 2.439).
    The seasonal aspect of activity was evident for Neotrombicula elegans, which exposed
    the autumn-winter period of the occurrence on hosts, and N. vernalis, with the
    winter-spring peak of abundance.

    Quality of East Midnapore Coast of West Bengal, India

  ab: Marine fishes are one of the important factors in stabilizing the local aquatic
    ecosystem and regulating the nutritional socio-economy of local fisher folks.
    The recent increases in anthropogenic activity, pollution and overfishing have
    led to the decline of marine fish species richness and their local aquatic habitats.
    In this study we sought to determine the inter-relationship between water quality,
    anthropogenic activity, and fish landing stations through a 31 km stretch of the
    East Midnapore coast in West Bengal, India which is known for its tourist destinations.
    The study was conducted monthly on different trawler fish landing sites from Dec
    2018 to Dec 2021. During this period, we took fish samples and identified them.
    We obtained water quality data regarding Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Concentration
    of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Turbidity, and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in order to identify
    further correlation between the water quality analysis and species diversity.
    154 numbers of commercially important marine fish species were documented. As
    per the IUCN database, 13% of the total fish species fall under the red list category
    and 16% of the species reveal a decreasing population trend. The availability
    of those red-listed fish throughout the season has been shown in the matrix plot
    to detect their gradual decrease in sighting. After analyzing the water quality
    data, we found out that DO, SST, Turbidity, and Chl-a correlate with the species
    richness on some sites and the water parameters are also differs during the seasons.
    Both fish species richness and water quality have been affected on those fish
    landing sites which have been subject to heavy anthropogenic loads.

  display_name: A Text Block Refinement Framework For Text Classification and Object
    Recognition From Academic Articles
  author:
  - ~
  ab: With the widespread use of the internet, it has become increasingly crucial
    to extract specific information from vast amounts of academic articles efficiently.
    Data mining techniques are generally employed to solve this issue. However, data
    mining for academic articles is challenging since it requires automatically extracting
    specific patterns in complex and unstructured layout documents. Current data mining
    methods for academic articles employ rule-based (RB) or machine learning (ML)
    approaches. However, using rule-based methods incurs a high coding cost for complex
    typesetting articles. On the other hand, simply using machine learning methods
    requires annotation work for complex content types within the paper, which can
    be costly. Furthermore, only using machine learning can lead to cases where patterns
    easily recognized by rule-based methods are mistakenly extracted. To overcome
    these issues, from the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting
    used in the specified publication, we emphasize implementing specific methods
    for specific characteristics in academic articles. We have developed a novel Text
    Block Refinement Framework (TBRF), a machine learning and rule-based scheme hybrid.
    We used the well-known ACL proceeding articles as experimental data for the validation
    experiment. The experiment shows that our approach achieved over 95% classification
    accuracy and 90% detection accuracy for tables and figures.

  ab: This article introduces datplot, an R package designed to prepare chronological
    data for visualization, focusing on the treatment of objects dated to overlapping
    periods of time. Datplot is suitable for all disciplines in which scientists long
    for a synoptic method that enables the visualization of the chronology of a collection
    of heterogeneously dated objects. It is especially helpful for visualizing trends
    in object assemblages over long periods of time—for example, the development of
    pottery styles—and it can also assist in the dating of stratigraphy. As both authors
    come from the field of classical archaeology, the examples and case study demonstrating
    the functionality of the package analyze classical materials. In particular, we
    focus on presenting an assemblage of epigraphic evidence from Bithynia (northwestern
    Turkey), with a microregional focal point in the territory of Nicaea (modern Iznik).
    In the article, we present the internal methodology of datplot and the process
    of preparing a dataset of categorically and numerically dated objects. We demonstrate
    visualizing the data prepared by datplot using kernel density estimation and compare
    the outcome with more established methods such as histograms and line graphs.

  ab: Freshwater mussels are important components of aquatic systems, where they cycle
    nutrients, stabilize streambeds, increase niche habitats, and are sources of food
    for mammals, birds, fish, and aquatic invertebrates. The biogeographically distinct
    Ozark Highlands is one of the oldest terrestrial regions on the planet and is
    home to over 200 endemic species including freshwater mussels. Key to the conservation
    and management of this mussel fauna is documenting their distribution and determining
    if any changes have occurred. In this study, our objectives were to document the
    diversity and distribution of the mussel fauna of the Missouri portion of the
    Eleven Point River, a National Wild and Scenic River, and determine if any changes
    had occurred over a 25+ yr period. During 1982–1985 and 2012–2019 we surveyed
    29 locations, including 12 surveyed during both periods, in summer to early fall,
    during low flow conditions with timed visual and tactile searches. We calculated
    metrics to measure the status, composition, and abundance of the mussel community,
    and examined the rate populations were experiencing extirpation or colonization.
    Historically, 21 freshwater mussel species were known from Eleven Point River;
    20 were observed live or as shell material in the present surveys. During both
    surveys, the Eleven Point River basin was dominated by members of the Lampsilini,
    which exhibit periodic life history strategies. We detected significant declines
    in the number of live individuals, CPUE, and richness at the 12 resurveyed locations.
    Freshwater mussel species in the Eleven Point River are being extirpated at a
    significantly higher rate than colonizing areas of the Eleven Point River. Causes
    for this decline remain unknown.

  ab: 'Abstract Metazoan parasite species composition changes with an increase in
    geographical distance, but not their functional traits. We compared the performance
    of the taxonomy and functional traits of metazoan parasites as bioindicators of
    chemical pollution along the continental shelf of the South Gulf of Mexico (sGOM).
    Parasites were obtained from Syacium gunteri and Syacium papillosum , together
    with hydrocarbons, heavy metals and physicochemical variables from water and sediments
    during 12 oceanographic cruises. We compared regions without oil extraction: Veracruz-Tamaulipas
    (VT) and Yucatan shelf (YS) and one with it, north-western end of YS to Coatzacoalcos,
    Veracruz (NYV). In addition to taxonomy, the trait-based approach community-weighted
    means (CWM) was performed. Species richness was compared between regions using
    rarefaction curves, and the taxonomic and trait composition between regions were
    compared using multivariate analyses. The relationships between taxonomy, traits
    and environmental variables were tested using BIOENV. We identified 57 species
    and body tegument, transmission, feeding mode, life stage and attachment organs
    as informative traits. By rarefaction, VT and YS had higher species richness than
    NYV for both hosts, but there were questionable values due to the small fish sample
    size. Except for YS, significant parasite community variability was detected by
    PERMANOVA using taxonomy and CWM for all regions, hosts and interactions. The
    same group of larval species was detected by SIMPER for regions and hosts, suggesting
    low functional turnover. BIOENV showed that polyaromatic hydrocarbons explained
    most of the variability. Taxonomy and functional traits produced similar explained
    variance, but the latter saved time analysis and financial resources.'

  title: Changes in the Mussel Fauna of the Jacks Fork, Missouri over 35 Years and
    Relationships with Species Traits

    and Relationships with Species Traits
  author:

  ab: We conducted a mussel survey of the Jacks Fork, Missouri, an Outstanding National
    Resource Water, to document mussel diversity and distribution in the watershed,
    to determine if changes had occurred since a previous survey in 1982, and to relate
    observed changes to species traits. We surveyed mussels with timed tactile or
    visual searches at 28 sites during summer from 2017 to 2019 and compared our results
    with the 1982 survey. Catch per unit effort, number of live individuals, species
    richness, and diversity were significantly lower in 2017–19 than in 1982. The
    proportion of extirpation at the 11 resurveyed sites averaged 0.85 (range 0.50–1.00)
    among species, and the proportion of colonization was 0.0 for all species. There
    were no differences in the relative abundance of tribes, life-history strategies,
    or species of conservation concern between the two surveys, suggesting that the
    decline has occurred evenly across species, tribes, and life-history strategies.
    Ten species are possibly extirpated from the basin. Causes of the mussel decline
    in the Jacks Fork basin are unknown.

  title: A Framework For Refining Text Classification and Object Recognition from
    Academic Articles
  display_name: A Framework For Refining Text Classification and Object Recognition
    from Academic Articles
  author:

  ab: With the widespread use of the internet, it has become increasingly crucial
    to extract specific information from vast amounts of academic articles efficiently.
    Data mining techniques are generally employed to solve this issue. However, data
    mining for academic articles is challenging since it requires automatically extracting
    specific patterns in complex and unstructured layout documents. Current data mining
    methods for academic articles employ rule-based(RB) or machine learning(ML) approaches.
    However, using rule-based methods incurs a high coding cost for complex typesetting
    articles. On the other hand, simply using machine learning methods requires annotation
    work for complex content types within the paper, which can be costly. Furthermore,
    only using machine learning can lead to cases where patterns easily recognized
    by rule-based methods are mistakenly extracted. To overcome these issues, from
    the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting used in the specified
    publication, we emphasize implementing specific methods for specific characteristics
    in academic articles. We have developed a novel Text Block Refinement Framework
    (TBRF), a machine learning and rule-based scheme hybrid. We used the well-known
    ACL proceeding articles as experimental data for the validation experiment. The
    experiment shows that our approach achieved over 95% classification accuracy and
    90% detection accuracy for tables and figures.
